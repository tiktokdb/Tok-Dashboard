    <p><b>TokBoard</b> is a creator workflow tool that connects to your Google account (with your consent) to read/write rows in Google Sheets that you control. We don’t run a database for your product data—your rows live in your Google account.</p>

    <h2 id="google-scopes">Google permissions (at a glance)</h2>
    <p>TokBoard connects to your Google account only to operate on the spreadsheet you use with the app. We don’t copy your sheet contents to our servers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.currentonly</code> — read/write cell ranges in your tracking sheet.</li>
      <li><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file</code> — create/open <em>only</em> the specific spreadsheet you use with TokBoard; TokBoard cannot see other Drive files.</li>
      <li><code>openid</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>profile</code> — sign in with Google and show your email.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including <em>Limited Use</em>. You can revoke access anytime at
      <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Google account email</b> (read-only), used to identify your session.</li>
      <li><b>OAuth access tokens</b> stored <b>only in your browser session storage</b>, to access Sheets/Drive.file on your behalf.</li>
      <li><b>Minimal metadata</b> about your spreadsheet (its <code>fileId</code>) so TokBoard can re-open it.</li>
      <li><b>Payment info</b> is processed by our payment provider (e.g., Stripe). TokBoard never sees full card data.</li>
      <li>Basic product analytics and error logs (aggregated, non-sensitive).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where your data lives</h2>
    <p>Your product rows are stored in Google Sheets within your Google account. We do not store a server copy of your sheet contents.</p>

    <h2>How we use data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To let you sign in and use TokBoard.</li>
      <li>To create/open your TokBoard spreadsheet and read/write the specific tabs/cell ranges you direct us to.</li>
      <li>To communicate essential updates (e.g., billing or service notices).</li>
      <li>To prevent abuse and improve reliability.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- NEW: Sharing / Disclosure -->
    <h2>Sharing / Disclosure of Google user data</h2>
    <p>We do <b>not</b> sell Google user data or share it with advertisers or data brokers. We share Google user data only with service providers that operate our app, acting as our processors and bound by confidentiality and security obligations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Cloud hosting & infrastructure</b> (to run the website/app).</li>
      <li><b>Logging/monitoring & crash reporting</b> (to keep the service reliable).</li>
      <li><b>Stripe</b> (payment processing and subscription management).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If legally required to disclose information, we limit the disclosure to what is necessary and permitted by law.</p>

    <!-- NEW: Data protection -->
    <h2>Data protection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Encryption in transit</b>: all requests use HTTPS/TLS.</li>
      <li><b>Least-privilege OAuth scopes</b>: only <code>spreadsheets</code> + <code>drive.file</code>; we do <b>not</b> request Drive-wide scopes.</li>
      <li><b>File scoping</b>: access is limited to the specific spreadsheet you use with TokBoard (identified by <code>fileId</code>).</li>
      <li><b>Token handling</b>: OAuth tokens are stored only in your browser session storage; we do not persist tokens on our servers.</li>
      <li><b>Access controls & auditing</b>: production access is limited to authorized personnel; logs are monitored for abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Helpful to reviewers: retention timeline -->
    <h2>Retention & deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We keep minimal metadata (email and selected spreadsheet <code>fileId</code>) while your account is active.</li>
      <li>On disconnect or request, we delete app-held Google data and tokens within <b>30 days</b>.</li>
      <li>Diagnostic logs are retained for up to <b>30 days</b>; billing records may be retained as required by law.</li>
    </ul>

      <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

    <h2>Payments</h2>
    <p>Subscriptions are handled by a third-party processor (e.g., Stripe). They act as the merchant of record for your payment details. TokBoard receives only minimal billing metadata (e.g., success/failed status, plan, email).</p>

    <h2>Cookies & local storage</h2>
    <p>We use local storage/cookies for sign-in state and basic preferences. You can clear them in your browser at any time.</p>
